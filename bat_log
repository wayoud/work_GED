To automate the process on a Windows Server using a batch script (.bat file), you can follow these steps. Here's a complete batch script that performs the required tasks:

Batch Script: load_and_log.bat

@echo off
setlocal

:: Configuration
set CSV_FILE=C:\path\to\your.csv
set DEST_DIR=C:\path\to\destination
for /f "tokens=1-4 delims=/ " %%a in ('date /t') do (set TODAY=%%c-%%a-%%b)
set NEW_NAME=%TODAY%.csv
set ORACLE_USER=username
set ORACLE_PASSWORD=password
set ORACLE_SID=oraclesid

:: Load CSV into Oracle
echo Loading CSV into Oracle...
sqlldr userid=%ORACLE_USER%/%ORACLE_PASSWORD%@%ORACLE_SID% control=load_csv.ctl log=load.log

if %ERRORLEVEL% neq 0 (
    echo Error loading CSV into Oracle. Check load.log for details.
    exit /b 1
)

:: Move and rename the CSV file
echo Moving and renaming the CSV file...
move "%CSV_FILE%" "%DEST_DIR%\%NEW_NAME%"

if %ERRORLEVEL% neq 0 (
    echo Error moving the CSV file.
    exit /b 1
)

:: Insert log record into Oracle
echo Inserting log record into Oracle...
(
echo connect %ORACLE_USER%/%ORACLE_PASSWORD%@%ORACLE_SID%
echo INSERT INTO load_log (load_date, file_path^)
echo VALUES (SYSDATE, '^%DEST_DIR%\%NEW_NAME%^');
echo COMMIT;
echo EXIT;
) | sqlplus -s

if %ERRORLEVEL% neq 0 (
    echo Error inserting log record into Oracle.
    exit /b 1
)

echo CSV file loaded, moved, and logged successfully.

endlocal

SQL*Loader Control File: load_csv.ctl

LOAD DATA
INFILE 'C:\path\to\your.csv'
INTO TABLE csv_data
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
(COLUMN1, COLUMN2, ...)

How to Use:

1. Save the batch script as load_and_log.bat.


2. Replace C:\path\to\your.csv and C:\path\to\destination with the actual file paths.


3. Replace username, password, and oraclesid with your Oracle credentials.


4. Save the control file as load_csv.ctl and place it in the same directory as the batch file.


5. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.


6. Navigate to the directory where the batch file is located.


7. Run the batch file:

load_and_log.bat
