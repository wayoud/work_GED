To execute a PL/SQL procedure via a batch file for scheduled execution, you can use SQL*Plus (a command-line interface for Oracle databases) in the batch file. Here are the steps:

1. Create the batch file (.bat):

Open a text editor and create a new batch file (run_procedure.bat) with the following content:

@echo off
REM Set Oracle environment variables
set ORACLE_HOME=C:\path\to\oracle_home
set PATH=%ORACLE_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
set NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.UTF8

REM Execute the PL/SQL procedure using SQL*Plus
sqlplus username/password@db_connection_string @run_plsql_procedure.sql

Replace:

C:\path\to\oracle_home with the actual path where Oracle is installed.

username/password with your database login credentials.

db_connection_string with your Oracle database connection details (e.g., hostname:port/sid).



2. Create the SQL file (run_plsql_procedure.sql):

In the same folder as your .bat file, create a file called run_plsql_procedure.sql with the following content:

BEGIN
   your_plsql_procedure_name;
END;
/

Replace your_plsql_procedure_name with the name of your procedure.


3. Schedule the batch file:

Use Windows Task Scheduler to run the .bat file at your desired time.

Open Task Scheduler.

Select Create Basic Task.

Set the schedule you prefer.

For the action, choose Start a Program and browse to your batch file (run_procedure.bat).

Save the task and it will run at the scheduled time.




This will execute the PL/SQL procedure as part of your scheduled task.
