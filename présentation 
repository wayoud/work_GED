Good morning,
Dear members of the jury, professors, and everyone present,

First, I would like to thank you all for being here today. It is a great honor for me to present my PhD research, titled:
"IoT Intrusion Detection Systems Enhancement Using Horizontal Federated Learning and Optimized WGAN-GP."

This work was done under the supervision of Professor Nadia Zoghib, and I am very grateful for her support and guidance during this project.

In this presentation, I will start by introducing the Internet of Things (IoT) and explaining its benefits and the security challenges it faces. Then, I will talk about the existing solutions and their limits. After that, I will present my approach, the methods we used, and the results I obtained. Finally, I will conclude with a summary and some future directions.

Now, let me start by introducing the Internet of Things.

The Internet of Things, or IoT, refers to a network of physical objects — or “things” — that are connected to the internet and can collect, send, and receive data. These objects are equipped with sensors, software, and other technologies that allow them to interact with their environment and with each other.

We can find IoT devices in many areas of our daily life.
For example:

In smart homes, healthcare,  industry, agriculture,  transportation


Thanks to IoT, we can collect real-time data, automate processes, improve efficiency, and create new services that were not possible before.


The Internet of Things is not only a technological revolution, but also an economic one. The global IoT market is growing very rapidly.


According to various studies, the total economic value generated by IoT is expected to reach 12 trillions of dollars in 2030.

This growth is driven by the ability of IoT to create new business models and services.

However, as the number of connected devices grows, so do the challenges, especially when it comes to security — which is the main focus of our research.
