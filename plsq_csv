To create a CSV file using PL/SQL, you can follow these steps:

1. Use UTL_FILE to write to the file system. You can use the UTL_FILE package in PL/SQL to create and write to files. However, the file must be created in a directory accessible to the Oracle Database server.


2. Set up the directory: The directory should be created in the Oracle database and given proper privileges. Hereâ€™s an example:

CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY my_directory AS '/path/to/your/directory';
GRANT READ, WRITE ON DIRECTORY my_directory TO your_user;


3. Write the PL/SQL block to generate the CSV file:

Below is an example of how to write data to a CSV file:

DECLARE
  v_file      UTL_FILE.FILE_TYPE;
  v_line      VARCHAR2(4000);
  v_delim     VARCHAR2(1) := ','; -- CSV delimiter
BEGIN
  -- Open the file for writing
  v_file := UTL_FILE.FOPEN('MY_DIRECTORY', 'output.csv', 'w', 32767);

  -- Write headers (optional)
  UTL_FILE.PUT_LINE(v_file, 'Column1' || v_delim || 'Column2' || v_delim || 'Column3');

  -- Loop through data and write rows
  FOR rec IN (SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM your_table) LOOP
    v_line := rec.column1 || v_delim || rec.column2 || v_delim || rec.column3;
    UTL_FILE.PUT_LINE(v_file, v_line);
  END LOOP;

  -- Close the file
  UTL_FILE.FCLOSE(v_file);
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    -- Handle exceptions
    IF UTL_FILE.IS_OPEN(v_file) THEN
      UTL_FILE.FCLOSE(v_file);
    END IF;
    RAISE;
END;


4. Explanation:

UTL_FILE.FOPEN opens a file for writing (w mode).

UTL_FILE.PUT_LINE writes a line of text to the file.

v_delim is the delimiter used to separate columns in the CSV file (usually a comma ,).

The FOR loop fetches data from a table (your_table) and writes it to the CSV file.

UTL_FILE.FCLOSE closes the file after writing.
